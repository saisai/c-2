EXTRA CREDIT:

1. For each line, write out the symbols you don't understand and see 
if you can guess what they mean. Write a little chart on paper with your 
guess that you can use to check later and see if you get it right.

I know all this shizzle.

2. Go back to the source code from the previous exercises and do a 
similar break-down to see if you're getting it. Write down what 
you don't know and can't explain to yourself.

I know all that shizzle.
