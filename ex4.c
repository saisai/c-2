EXTRA CREDIT

1. Fix this program using Valgrind and the compiler as your guide.

Valgrind is fucked on Mountain Lion.

2. Read up on Valgrind on the internet.

Fascinating,

3. Download other software and build it by hand. 
Try something you already use but never built for yourself.

Bitch, please.

4. Look at how the Valgrind source files are laid out in the 
source directory and read its Makefile. Don't worry, none of 
that makes sense to me either.
